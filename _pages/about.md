Hi, I'm a first-year Ph.D. Student in the <a href="http://stat.uchicago.edu/">Department of Statistics, University of Chicago</a>. Previously, I'm graduated summa cum laude with Guo Muoruo Scholarship from <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a> in 2023. In Spring 2023, I was a junior research assistant in the <a href="cs.hku.hk">Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong</a>, working with <a href="http://difanzou.github.io/">Prof. Difan Zou</a>. 

My recent research interests cover high dimensional statistics, optimization theory and there intersections.
