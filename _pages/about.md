Welcome to my homepage! My name is Beining Wu (吴贝宁). I'm a junior undergraduate from <i><a href="https://bs.ustc.edu.cn">the School of Management</a>, <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn">University of Science and Technology of China</a></i> (USTC). Now I'm pursuing a B.S. degree in <b>statistics</b>. My recent resarch interests contain high dimensional statistical inference problem and its application to machine learning problem, network analysis and theoretical reinforcement learning problem. Curruntly, I'm starting my research career under the supervision of <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zwp">Prof. Weiping Zhang</a>. I'll apply for 2023 fall Ph.D. programs.
