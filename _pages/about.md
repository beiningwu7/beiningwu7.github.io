Welcome to my homepage! My name is Beining Wu (吴贝宁). Now I'm a junior undergraduate from <i><a href="https://bs.ustc.edu.cn">the School of Management</a>, <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn">University of Science and Technology of China</a></i>. I'm pursuing a B.S. degree in <b>statistics</b>. 

My recent resarch interests contain high dimensional statistical inference with applications to machine learning problem, network analysis and reinforcement learning theory. 

Curruntly, I'm doing an undergraduate research program under the supervision of <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zwp">Prof. Weiping Zhang</a> from USTC. We are paying attention to the eimpirical process and its applications to statistical machine learning.
