I'm a senior undergraduate student in the <a href="https://bs.ustc.edu.cn">Department of Statistics and Finance</a>, <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn">University of Science and Technology of China(USTC)</a>. In the year of 2022, I received the 42-nd Guo Muoruo scholarship, the highest honor for undergraduates in USTC. 

Currently I'm working with <a href="purplebamboo1993.github.io">Dr. Ziwei Zhu</a>, who was an Assistant Professor at University of Michigan. I'm also very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/">Prof. Jun S. Liu<a> from Harvard University on specific projects. 
In spring 2023, I'll join the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong as a junior research assistant, advised by Prof. Difan Zou. 

My recent research interests cover high dimensional statistics, optimization theory and modern learning theory.
