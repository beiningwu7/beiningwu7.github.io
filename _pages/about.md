Hi, I'm a first-year Ph.D. Student at the <a href="http://stat.uchicago.edu/">Department of Statistics, University of Chicago</a>. I received B.Sc. in statistics at <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a> in 2023, graduated with Guo Muoruo scholarship. In Spring 2023, I was a junior research assistant in the <a href="cs.hku.hk">Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong</a>, working with <a href="http://difanzou.github.io/">Prof. Difan Zou</a>. 

My research interests cover high dimensional statistics, optimization theory and their intersections.
