I'm a senior undergraduate student in the <a href="https://bs.ustc.edu.cn">Department of Statistics and Finance</a>, <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>. In the year of 2022, I received the 42-nd Guo Muoruo scholarship, the highest honor for undergraduates in USTC.

Currently I'm working with <a href="https://purplebamboo1993.github.io/personal_web/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Ziwei Zhu</a>, who was an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan. I'm also very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/" target="_blank">Prof. Jun S. Liu</a> from Harvard University on specific projects. In spring 2023, I'll join the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong as a junior research assistant, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/difan-zou" target="_blank"> Prof. Difan Zou</a>.

My recent research interests cover high dimensional statistics, optimization theory and modern learning theory.

I'm applying for the statistics Ph.D. program that starts in fall 2023 semester. Wish me luck.
